Real UAV controlï¼Œ using the vicon to locate the uav.  The position with yaw can be set to control the uav, the target point is send to mavros , which processes and delivers the msgs to the PX4.

Thanks to Jianjun Gui and Haoxin Zhang, who  helped a lot for this work.  The work is fineshed in Defense Innovation Institute, Chinese Academy of Military Science, 2021.

git clone https://github.com/9woods123/real_uav_control.git

catkin_make

```

and launch the uav control nodes:

`source  your_catkin_name/devel/setup.bash `
